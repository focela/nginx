# Open File Cache Configuration for Nginx
# This configuration optimizes file handling by caching metadata and open file 
# descriptors, improving performance for frequently accessed files.

# Enable the open file cache
# - max: Maximum number of cached file descriptors.
# - inactive: Time period (in seconds) after which inactive entries are removed.
open_file_cache max={{NGINX_OPEN_FILE_CACHE_MAX}} inactive={{NGINX_OPEN_FILE_CACHE_INACTIVE}};

# Define the validity period for cached metadata
# - Controls how often the cache is revalidated.
open_file_cache_valid {{NGINX_OPEN_FILE_CACHE_VALID}};

# Set the minimum number of accesses required to cache a file
# - Prevents rarely used files from being cached.
open_file_cache_min_uses {{NGINX_OPEN_FILE_CACHE_MIN_USES}};

# Enable caching of file access errors
# - Useful for logging and debugging file access issues.
