# Reverse Proxy Real IP Configuration for Nginx
# This configuration ensures that Nginx can correctly identify the real client IP 
# when operating behind a reverse proxy or load balancer.

# Define the header that contains the real client IP
# - The header is typically set by upstream proxies (e.g., X-Forwarded-For).
real_ip_header {{NGINX_REAL_IP_HEADER}};

# Specify trusted IP ranges that can provide the real IP
# - Only IPs in these ranges will be considered trusted to set the real IP.
set_real_ip_from {{NGINX_SET_REAL_IP_FROM}};
