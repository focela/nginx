# Nginx Monitoring Configuration
# This configuration sets up a monitoring endpoint using `stub_status`
# to expose basic metrics for internal monitoring purposes.

    # Listen on a local-only port
    listen 73;

    # Define the monitoring endpoint
    location /stub_status {
        # Enable Nginx's stub_status module for real-time stats
        stub_status on;

        # Disable access logs for this location to reduce logging overhead
        access_log off;

        # Set a custom server header to include the Nginx version
        more_set_headers "Server: nginx/{{NGINX_VERSION}}";

        # Restrict access to the monitoring endpoint
        allow 127.0.0.1;  # Allow only local access
        deny all;         # Deny all other IP addresses
